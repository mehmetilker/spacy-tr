============================= Dependency Parsing =============================
ℹ Found 3664 sentences with an average length of 10.3 words.
⚠ The training data contains 1.01 sentences per document. When there are very
few documents containing more than one sentence, the parser will not learn how
to segment longer texts into sentences.
ℹ Found 405 nonprojective train sentences
ℹ Found 119 nonprojective dev sentences
ℹ 32 labels in train data
ℹ 209 labels in projectivized train data
⚠ Low number of examples for label 'advcl' (4)
⚠ Low number of examples for label 'parataxis' (10)
⚠ Low number of examples for label 'csubj' (8)
⚠ Low number of examples for label 'dep' (1)
⚠ Low number of examples for label 'vocative' (2)
⚠ Low number of examples for 174 labels in the projectivized dependency trees
used for training. You may want to projectivize labels such as punct before
training in order to improve parser performance.
